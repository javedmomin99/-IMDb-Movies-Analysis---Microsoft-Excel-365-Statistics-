In this project, I delved into the fascinating world of movie data analysis using Microsoft Excel 365, employing advanced statistical techniques. The aim was to extract valuable insights from IMDb's extensive collection of movies, exploring factors that influence a movie's success. Through meticulous data cleansing, statistical analysis, and the power of Excel, I unearthed patterns and correlations, providing a deeper understanding of what makes a movie truly exceptional. This project showcases my ability to turn raw data into meaningful insights in the realm of cinema and statistics.
